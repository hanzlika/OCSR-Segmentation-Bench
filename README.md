# OCSR-Segmentation-Bench
Benchmarking of freely available tools for segmentation of chemical structure images from publication papers.


## Segmentation tools

### DECIMER-Image-Segmentation

Used in tandem with [DECIMER-Image-Transformer](https://github.com/Kohulan/DECIMER-Image_Transformer) in [decimer.ai](https://decimer.ai/)

I also used this tool for [Drug hunter extractor](https://github.com/hanzlika/drughunter-molecule-extractor)

### ChemSAM

[Repo](https://github.com/mindrank-ai/ChemSAM/tree/master)

### OSRA

Used by [ChemSchematicResolver](http://www.chemschematicresolver.org/demo)

[Python wrapper](https://github.com/edbeard/pyosra)
  
### YoDe-Segmentation

## TODO - Benchmarking set

TODO - Look around for existing benchamarking sets

QUESTION - How to automatically evaluate image segmentation?
